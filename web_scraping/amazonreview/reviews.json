Both unabridged and abridged editions are excellent", "reviewBody": "\"The 48 Laws of Power\" was a wake-up call for me. It reminded me of Machiavell's \"The Prince\" which I read in high school. However, I thought \"The Prince\" had no relevance to my life since I did not need to decide whether or not to chop the head off a defeated king.Robert Greene's book helped to make the connection between Machiavelli's principles and methods and what I have experienced in my professional career. While nearly everyone claims to be straightforward and honest, some are adept at maneuvering themselves into advantageous positions. \"The 48 Laws\" explains the many tools these individuals use to increase their power, usually at the expense of yours. I have found the most valuable books to help me learn about life through the experiences of others and this book is packed full of wisdom throughout the ages.Several of the 48 laws that were insightful to me were:Law 1 - Never outshine the masterLaw 4 - Always say less than necessaryLaw 9 - Win through your actions, never through argumentLaw 16 - Use absence to increase respect and honorLaw 20 - Do not commit to anyoneLaw 29 - Plan all the way to the endLaw 38 - Think as you like but behave like othersLaw 46 - Never appear too perfectLaw 48 - Assume formlesslessA few of these may sound obivious, silly, puzzling. However, there are plenty of historical examples to explain each law (in the form of \"observance of the law\", \"violation of the law\", and \"reversals\"). I may use a few of the laws in the future but mostly, I will be aware of the laws to watch my back.Both the unabridged and abridged versions are excellent - 'Machiavelli's \u00a8'The Prince\u00a8 on steroids. If you have the time, go with the unabridged edition because it has many more historical examples. However, if you are time constrained, the abridged version is terrific as well.I first listened to the abridged version and found it to have many pearls of wisdom. As the author suggests, I identified many examples of the laws in my professional and academic career. I wished I had read (or listened) to this book earlier in my youth.I then listened to the unabridged version because I was interested in the full text and it did not disappoint with many more historical examples - \u00a8the wise learn from the mistakes of others.\u00a8", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on July 16, 2015", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "3 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/product-reviews/0140280197?pageNumber=14&reviewerType=all_reviews"},

Pl", "reviewBody": "I'm the type who, \"buys me now, reads me later...\" type of book buyer. I first tried to read Robert Greene's book some time back, I couldn't get into it. So I put it to the side for the time being....A) In 2012 I began reading \"Sun Tzu For Success\" by Gerald Michaelson and Steven Michaelson. As a result my eyes were opened to the possibilities in how to see the big picture in the success planning. As well as how thinking in proactive mode can produce stronger results than reaction thinking like most of us would do.B) So when I finally read \"48 Laws\", it was like life-lessons reading in how to get along with people. Or how immature people will behave toward you. Which I never understood since most of us know about morals, ethics and family-values in our civilized society of the 21st century.C) The biggest chapter for me was Law#24; \"Play the Perfect Courtier\". It's how to play internal politics either at work or in social groups. Wow!, what an eye opener.D) Or how about Law#46: \"Never Appear Too Perfect\". Your efforts to be ambitious, successful or even just plain charming can create envy and people hating you for no reason but for you being at your best.E) Another is Law#18:\"Do Not Build Fortresses to Protect Yourself-Isolation is Dangerous\" It's what happens when you are work alone and cut yourself off. You lose \"being out of the loop\" from very important information to dominate from.F) Even if you are a person of high character and a good person. Your friends and working peers won't always see the world the way you do. So protect yourself from these bad people.F) SO YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK!... IT'S TODAY'S BIBLE!So now I'm reading \"The New Boss\" by Peter Fischer. \"How To Survive the First 100 Days\" whether starting a new job or new to a group. I'm using \"48 Laws\" like a reference book for when I observe a behavior and ask why are they?...

Really like it. Caught me off guard as it is written in a similar style(in my opinion) as the \"Art of War\" (one of my favorites) is written in. Based on the author's bio was expecting something more trendy, but once I went back and read the preface the style made sense in that he is cherry picking some of the best ideas about power over the last 3000 years - not just pop-culture stuff.What I really liked about it is a reader can just pick off one of the laws per day, and dive as deep into each as one wants. Any one of the 48 can increase someone's awareness, an help them better achieve their purpose. Nice to have a book that has more than just one main idea and 155 pages of dribble surrounding it (like most bestselling business books).In summary, this is going on my informal book recommendation list. I think it is one of those few books that I have seen that is interesting enough to actually make time to read in a few days, but will take a life to master.

The laws themselves are well thought out and backed up with examples, but nearly every anecdote in the book brings the reader back 500 years into a time that wasn't necessarily relatable. I give the author credit in the sense that history repeats itself and the examples are still valid, but it would have been nice to read a mix of contemporary and a mix of historical anecdotes. I just found the book a little bit slow given I was reading about kings and queens and wars the entire time. Power is a subject applicable to ALL domains, and I felt this book was a bit narrow.Also, I found it very distracting how the author includes one-off snippets between stories that are totally unrelated. It disrupts the flow of the book.All that said, this book is well worth the read. I just wouldn't suggest reading it like a normal book.

Because of my interest in the 48 Laws, I began the Art of Seduction again; reading these two books, side by side(not literally), I saw connections, and wanted to finish them; because of my curiosity, I wanted to see if these principles can be applied.I like the author's style of writing, explaining historical events, describing classical literary works; he would then explain observances and transgressions of these Laws, and how they can be interpreted.I really liked this book, and will come back to it again for another read.", "verifiedPurchase": "Verified Purchase", "postDate": "Reviewed in the United States \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 on February 6, 2015", "starRating": "5.0 out of 5 stars", "helpful": "2 people found this helpful", "nextPage": "/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/product-reviews/0140280197?pageNumber=35&reviewerType=all_reviews"},
